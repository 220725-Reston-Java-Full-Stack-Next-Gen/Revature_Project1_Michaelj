# Project Title: Blockchain Reimbursement

## Executive Summary: 
The project is going to be about logging into the blockchain with your username, password and private key. Employees can sign in and sign up and make reimbursement claims about spending they did in the company name. The user will get to log in and check their claim history while the managers will be able to either deny or approve the request. Managers will log into the application the same way, however their accesscodes give them special permissions. If a claim is accepted, the employee will be paid in crypto currency.

## User Stories:
I want to be able to combine the blockchain with this project by implementing private key phrases. When a user signs up, they will be given a 8 word phrase that will be unique to them. This key is not needed to log in, it will only be needed to submit, accept, revoke or deny reimbursement requests. The user is also going to be able to choose which currency's they would like to recive their payments. 

## Flowcharts:

### Employee -> sign in/log in -> view pending claims/ make new claim -> wait for claims to be settled -> recive notice that the claim has been approved or denied
### Manager -> log in -> view existing claims -> deny or approve claim -> state a reason
